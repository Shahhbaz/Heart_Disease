# Heart_Disease
Its a dataset I have downloaded from the kaggle for personal project.
The aim of this project is to predict whether paitent will get heart disease or not with the help of given Data set.
The Dataset is small so it doesnt have any null values.
I have done Feature engineering.
Its a Classification Problem so I have Used 2 models Logistic Regression and  K-nn.
The accuracy of Logistic Regression is more than K-nn.
